## Get Started

You can start using Teiden instantly at [teiden.vercel.app](https://teiden.vercel.app), or self-host your own instance by following the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 14+
- Supabase account

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file with the following variables:

```
# Supabase credentials
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key

# Security keys
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-32-character-encryption-key
SERVER_SECRET_KEY=your-server-secret-key
```

### Database Setup

1. Create a new Supabase project
2. Run the SQL script in `db/schema.sql` to set up the required tables and policies

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

### Production Deployment

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Start the server
npm start
```

## Development & Agents

Teiden includes a Python-based agent that automatically fetches and processes OpenAI usage data. To run the agent locally:

```bash
npm run dev:cron
```

Or run the Python agent directly:

```bash
bash scripts/run-usage-fetcher.sh
```

The agent requires Python 3.9+, LangGraph 0.4.1+, and dependencies listed in `scripts/requirements.txt`. The first run will set up a virtual environment automatically.

## Security Considerations

- Encryption keys should be at least 32 characters and stored securely
- API keys are never exposed in client-side code or logs
- Row-level security ensures data isolation between users
